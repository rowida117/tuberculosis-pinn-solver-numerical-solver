#  Physics-Informed Neural Network for Tuberculosis Modeling


Welcome! This project explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to solve a tuberculosis ODE model.

📄 [Download Full Report](report.pdf)

This project presents a computational solution to a tuberculosis (TB) compartmental model using:
- Classical numerical solvers
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

The PINN approach integrates the system of ODEs into the neural network training process, allowing for continuous and accurate approximations of disease dynamics over time.

## Project Overview

We modeled the spread and progression of TB using a system of four ODEs representing the following compartments:
- **S(t)**: Susceptible individuals
- **E(t)**: Exposed (infected but not yet infectious)
- **I(t)**: Infectious individuals
- **L(t)**: Latent or partially treated individuals

Two solution methods were implemented:
1. **Numerical integration methods** (e.g., Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg, Heun’s Method)
2. **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** trained using PyTorch

## Trials 

##  Attempted Method: Romberg Integration

###  What is Romberg Integration?

Romberg Integration is a numerical method used to estimate definite integrals with high precision. It combines the **Trapezoidal Rule** with **Richardson Extrapolation** to refine the accuracy of the result over successive approximations.

It starts from the basic trapezoidal estimate:

```
Tₙ = (h / 2) × [f(a) + 2 × ∑ f(xᵢ) + f(b)]
```

Then applies Richardson extrapolation recursively to eliminate lower-order error terms:

```
R(n, m) = [4ᵐ × R(n, m−1) − R(n−1, m−1)] / (4ᵐ − 1)
```

This builds a Romberg table where the bottom-right value is the most accurate approximation of the integral.

---

###  Why Romberg Integration Did Not Work in Our Case

Although Romberg is powerful for integrating functions of a single variable (usually time), it is **not suitable** for our TB ODE model because:

- Our ODE system has the form:

```
dy/dt = f(y)
```

  where **`f(y)` does not depend on time `t`** explicitly.

- Romberg Integration is most effective when integrating:

```
∫ f(t) dt
```

  with function values changing significantly over `t`.

- In our model, since the right-hand side `f(y)` is independent of `t`, the integration essentially becomes:

```
yₙ₊₁ ≈ yₙ + f(yₙ) × dt
```

  which reduces to **Euler’s method**, but with **extra computational cost** and **no added accuracy**.
