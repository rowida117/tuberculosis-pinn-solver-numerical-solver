This project presents a computational solution to a tuberculosis (TB) compartmental model using:
- Classical numerical solvers
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

The PINN approach integrates the system of ODEs into the neural network training process, allowing for continuous and accurate approximations of disease dynamics over time.

## Project Overview

We modeled the spread and progression of TB using a system of four ODEs representing the following compartments:
- **S(t):** Susceptible
- **E(t):** Exposed
- **I(t):** Infected
- **L(t):** Latent

Two solution methods were implemented:
1. **Numerical integration methods** (e.g., Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg, Heunâ€™s Method, Gauss Quadrature)
2. **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** trained using PyTorch

##  Methodology

- PINN implementation includes:
  - Fully-connected feedforward network
  - Tanh and Softplus activations
  - Loss terms: physics residual, initial conditions, initial derivative, data points
  - Two-phase optimization: Adam + L-BFGS
  - Curriculum learning for gradual physics emphasis

- Numerical results were used both for evaluation and for guiding PINN convergence.

## Results

- PINN successfully approximated all compartments and extrapolated 5Ã— beyond training range.
- Final extrapolated mean square errors (MSE):

| Compartment | MSE (t = 0â€“100) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| S           | 0.281159        |
| E           | 0.264011        |
| I           | 0.002425        |
| L           | 0.000004        |

- PINN outperformed numerical integration in speed (7900% faster).
